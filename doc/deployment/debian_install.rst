Debian Package Install
======================

.. note::

   Debian packages are not yet available. The WMX ROS2 application must
   currently be built from source.

See :doc:`source_build` for build instructions.

.. todo::

   Create ``apt``-installable Debian packages for ``wmx_ros2_message``
   and ``wmx_ros2_package`` for streamlined deployment.
